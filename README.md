Xdg library
===========

[Documentation](http://vilkov.github.com/libxdg) - online documentation generated by doxygen.

Features:
---------

 - Straight C-implementation of serializable AVL trees;
 - Access to ["Shared MIME-info Database"](http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/shared-mime-info-spec) by using of freedesktop.org [xdgmime](http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xdg/xdgmime) library;
 - Indexed (by using of AVL trees) access to all ".desktop" files and its contents (implementation of ["Desktop Entry Specification"](http://standards.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/desktop-entry-spec-latest.html));
 - Cache all (include indexes) gathered information from all ".desktop" and ".list" files (["Desktop Entry Specification"](http://standards.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/desktop-entry-spec-latest.html)) into one single binary file which then can be mmap'ed without a single allocation of memory (just updates pointers in mmap'ed memory);
 - Indexed (by using of AVL trees) access to icon themes and its contents (implemetation of ["Icon Theme Specification"](http://standards.freedesktop.org/icon-theme-spec/icon-theme-spec-latest.html) and ["Icon Naming Specification"](http://standards.freedesktop.org/icon-naming-spec/icon-naming-spec-latest.html));
 - Editable set of implemented specifications (at build time);
 - No dependencies.
