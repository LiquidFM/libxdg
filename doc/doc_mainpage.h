/** @page desktop_cache_format_page Binary cache of Desktop Entry Specification.
 * The specification can be found
 * <a href="http://standards.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/desktop-entry-spec-latest.html">here</a>.
 *
 * This specification describes format of \a ".desktop" and \a ".list" files.
 * Purpose of the library is to provide fastest possible access to contents of this files.
 * This goal is achieved by using of AVL trees. They were chosen because AVL trees are more
 * rigidly balanced than red-black trees, leading to slower insertion and removal but faster retrieval.
 *
 * Files with data (\a ".desktop" and \a ".list" files) are stored in several different directories.
 * Usually, according to the
 * <a href="http://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html">"Base Directory Specification"</a>
 * there are, at least, two directories: one for user defined settings and one for system defined settings.
 * In this regard, the library supports generation of binary cache files for each separate directory.
 * Besides, during initialization, the library integrates information from different directories regardless
 * the directory contains binary cache or not. This integration is very symbolic, because it's just placing
 * pointers to the relevant AVL trees. At the same time, reading from the binary cache file doesn't use
 * such functions as malloc and free, only mmap. In other words, the binary cache consists of constructed AVL trees
 * and data stored in their nodes.
 *
 *
 *
 * The file format of a binary cache looks as follows:
 * <ul>
 * <li> 4 \c bytes for version of a cache file.
 *
 * <li> List of XdgFileWatcher structures (at least one zeroed structure, i.e NULL-terminated C list).
 *   @n This list is used during loading of cache to determine validity of cache.
 *   @see xdg_app_cache_file_is_valid()
 *        @n xdg_app_refresh()
 *
 * <li> AVL tree of all \a ".desktop" files located in the same directory (and subdirectories) as cache file.
 *   @n Each key of this tree is a name of \a ".desktop" file (e.g. \a kde4-kate.desktop).
 *   @n Each value of this tree is an AVL tree of XdgApp items, which in turns is an AVL tree of
 *   XdgAppGroup items, which is an AVL tree of XdgAppGroupEntry items.
 *   @note This tree serves as a container of \a ".desktop" files for the two other trees in cache.
 *
 * <li> AVL tree of associations of mime type with \a ".desktop" files.
 *   @n Each key of this tree is a name of the first part of mime type (e.g. \a text).
 *   @n Each value of this tree is an AVL tree of a second part of mime type (e.g. \a html), which contains a
 *   list of pointers to XdgApp items.
 *   @note This tree stores connections between a certain \a ".desktop" file and mime types.
 *   @see xdg_known_apps_lookup()
 *
 * <li> AVL tree of merged contents of all \a ".list" files located in the same directory (and subdirectories) as cache file.
 *   @n Each key of this tree is a name of a group from \a ".list" file (e.g. \a Default \a Applications).
 *   @n Each value of this tree is an AVL tree of entries, which in it's turn is an AVL tree of
 *   {mime type, \a ".desktop" files} pairs in the format: @n\a "text/plain=kde4-kate.desktop;diffuse.desktop;".
 *   @note This tree stores connections (known from \a ".list" files) between a certain \a ".desktop" file and
 *   mime types.
 *   @see xdg_apps_lookup()
 * </ul>
